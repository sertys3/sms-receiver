<h3>Step by Step instruction for Windows</h3>
<!-- START --><p>
You need about 150 MB free space on drive C or whereever you install it.
<p>
Cygwin is not a Unix emulator. 
It is a set of standard programs from the Unix world, that were translated to windows. 
Cygwin adds a lot "missing" functions to windows, so most Source codes for Unix can be translated to Windows with minor changes.
</p>
<p>
It is very useful to know the basic Unix commands but you can also
continue with this instruction if you have no Unix knowledge.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Go to <a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_new">www.cygwin.com</a> and
click on <b>Install Now</b>.
</p>
<p>
Click on <b>Next</b> until you can select a download server. Select one
that is near to you and click on <b>Next</b>
</p>
<p>
After the list of cygwin packages is received you can select the parts
that you want to install. Do not deselect anything.
</p>
<p>
Open the <b>Devel</b> list and select <b>gcc</b> and <b>make</b> by clicking one time on them. 
If you want to use statusmonitor feature, a <b>gcc-g++</b> package is also needed.
Then click on <b>Next</b> until you can see the progress bar. 
The default settings are Ok.
</p>
<p>
Download the <a href="http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/packages/">SMS Server Tools 3</a> into the directory c:\cygwin\usr\src. 
Some windows versions store the file with a wrong filename (*.tar.tar) instead of *.tar.gz but this does not cause any problem.
</p>
<p>
Start a <b>Cygwin Bash Shell</b> from the Windows start menu. This shell
is similar to the MS-DOS window but it accepts Unix commands.
</p>
<p>
Enter the following commands:
</p>
<p>
cd /usr/src<br>
tar -xzf smstools3*<br>
cd smstools3<br>
make<br>
make install<br>
</p>
<p>
You should not see any error message. Warnings are acceptable.
</p>
<p>
Open the file <b>c:\cygwin\etc\smsd.conf</b> and modify it as described in
<a href="configure.html">configuring</a>.
<br>
The name of the first serial port is <b>/dev/com1</b>. Use
always / instead of \ when you write directory names. The whole config file is case-sensitive.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Do not use a device name, like COM1, as a modem name (like "[COM1]").
While a message is received, a file starting with this name is created and Windows handles it as a device.
This will cause a modem process to be freezed.
</p>
<p>
Run smsd by entering the command <b>smsd -s</b> (with status monitor) in a Cygwin Window, or use <b>sms3</b> script.
</p>
<p>
Send short messages by creating <a href="fileformat.html">SMS Files</a> in
the directory c:\cygwin\var\spool\sms\outgoing or by using the command <b>sendsms</b> in another Cygwin Window.
</p>
<h3>Running smsd as a Windows service</h3>
<p>
If you like to install smsd (version >= 3.0.3) as a service, then enter this command in a Cygwin Window:
<p>
<b>cygrunsrv --install smsd --path /usr/local/bin/smsd.exe --type auto --shutdown --env "CYGWIN=server" 
--env "PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin" --desc "SMS Server Tools 3" --args "-t"</b>
</p>
<p>
You can then start and stop this service using the control panel of windows or the windows commands <b>net start smsd</b> and <b>net stop smsd</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Version >= 3.0.3 should be run in terminal mode.
Last argument <i>--args "-t"</i> enables this mode.
If you have previously installed smsd as a service, remove it (cygrunsrv -R smsd) and reinstall with a new command.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you have had a previous version in use, there might be <i>--neverexits</i> option defined in the command.
This option should not be used, because it causes an error message while the service is stopped.

sendmail, fetchmail, formail, sed, cut, grep, awk.
